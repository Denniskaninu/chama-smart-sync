## üìö Codebase Overview

ChamaSync is built for maintainability and extensibility. Key architectural choices include:

- **Modular Design:**  
  Each feature (auth, groups, contributions, loans, messaging) is encapsulated in its own directory.
- **Type Safety:**  
  TypeScript and Zod ensure data integrity throughout the stack.
- **Realtime Data:**  
  Firebase Firestore and Storage are used for live updates and persistent storage.
- **AI Integration:**  
  Genkit-powered functions validate M-Pesa references, reducing manual errors and fraud.

Feel free to explore and contribute! Start with the `/app` directory for routing, `/components` for UI, and `/lib` for utility functions.
